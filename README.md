# System Administration Projects Repository

### About This Repository
This repository is a collection of hands-on projects that demonstrate my practical skills in **Windows Server Administration**. The labs are designed to simulate real-world scenarios, covering foundational server configurations, network service management, and advanced policy enforcement. Each project includes documented steps, key configurations, and the outcomes, serving as a portfolio of my system administration capabilities. This is a living document and will be updated as more projects are completed.

### **Projects**

* [**Windows Server Configuration:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/System-Administration-Projects/tree/main/01-Windows-Server-Configuration) This project focuses on the initial setup and configuration of a Windows Server domain. It simulates a foundational lab environment where a Windows Server is configured as a domain controller and a Windows client is integrated into the domain.

* [**Server Manager Group Policy Object Configuration:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/System-Administration-Projects/tree/main/02-Server-Manager-Group-Policy-Object-Configuration) This project highlights the essential use of **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** to manage and secure a Windows Server environment. It details the creation and application of GPOs to disable key features like the Control Panel, Command Prompt, and Registry Editor, as well as to customize the desktop environment by removing the Recycle Bin icon.

* [**Configuring DNS and DHCP in Windows Server:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/System-Administration-Projects/tree/main/03-Configuring-DNS-and-DHCP-in-Windows-Server) This project demonstrates the configuration and management of two critical network services: **Domain Name System (DNS)** and **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**. The lab covers the creation of A and CNAME DNS records and the setup of a DHCP server with a new IPv4 scope, ensuring clients can resolve names and obtain IP addresses automatically.
